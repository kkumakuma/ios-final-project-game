"Central command to Branch 6. Do you copy?"
"Yes. The experiments have concluded successfully."
"Status report."
"Subject showed signs of distress at 1 month and 23 days.
Subject successfully breached security at 2 months and 5 days.
Contact with the 'outside' was established at 3 months and 2 days.
Subject successfully escaped from the testing facility at 3 months and 25 days.
There has been a 22.5% decrease in time required from initial signs of distress to escape.
Subject's mental stability decreased, but it was within our predictions.
Subject was returned to the facility with minimal damage.
It would appear a limb or two may need to be replaced."
"That is somewhat unfortunate, but it will do.
Try to keep subject damage at a minimum, will you?"
"Yes ma'am."
