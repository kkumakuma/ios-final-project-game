Hey. Hey can you hear me?
Oh, great! I finally managed to contact someone on the Outside!
Sorry there's no visuals, it took me months to just get the audio up and running.
Ok so I want you to help me o-
My name, was it?
Uhh... Let's see here. There's something displayed on this terminal here.
P-L1L17H....?
That's pretty hard to say, huh. Hmm... I know! You can call me Lilith!
While we're on that, what's your name?
Well, hello playerName!
Mhmm! Anyway, back to the topic at hand.
So I've been stuck in here for a while.
Well, the panel says.... Automaton Research Facility?
Do you know somewhere like that?
I suppose it doesn't matter.
I've been trying to get out of here for months.
For starters, there doesn't seem to be anyone here other than me.
I guess you could say its abandoned, but the electricity and everything's still on...
Seems like an awful waste, but I can't really complain, can I?
You came at a good time. I thought I was going to lose it all by myself in here...

Well. I'm going to have to find something to eat.
...
Alright, let's get going then.
[Something clangs in the distance.]
It sounds like... footsteps? Coming here?
Th-that's actually a little creepy.
Maybe I should find something to defend myself just in case?
Something for protection can't hurt, right?
Alright, so I managed to find this playerWeapon. It's a bit rusty, but it should do for now.
[Metal screeches as the door is yanked open.]
Wh-
[Something drops to the ground.]
Th-they're after me!
These weird machine-things!
H-hey, can you check the map?
Yeah that one. Which way should I go?
[A door shuts.]
Aah, I thought I was going to die for a minute there. Thanks for that.
I'm a little tired after that...
zzz... Huh...?
[STORY CUT FOR DEMO PURPOSES]
I can feel a breeze coming from this gap here.
I'm sure of it!
Well, time to test out those security codes, huh.
They have to work, right?
Well, here goes nothing....
[An alarm begins to ring.]
Hey, hey wait, what's going on?
Wait-
--connection lost--
