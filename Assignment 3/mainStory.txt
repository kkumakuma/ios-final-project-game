Besides the bed you woke up from, the room is featureless save for a screen and a table.
On the table is a playerWeapon.
Before getting a chance to get your bearings, the screen flickers on.

For the purposes of an unbiased study,  we here at the Facility will not return your memories until the end of the experiment.
We appreciate your understanding.”
“Please pick up your playerWeapon and proceed.”
