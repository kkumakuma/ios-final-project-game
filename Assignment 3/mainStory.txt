Log A2-4: Connection success.
I managed to contact someone on the Outside.
This might be the one chance I need to get out of here.
Listen, I need you to h-
Wh- My name?
Let's see. There's something displayed on this terminal here.
Never had a need for names in here, and I don't remember anything from before... SUBJ-L1-L17H....?
A bunch of letters and numbers... I suppose Lilith will have to do.
Since you seem insistent on self-introductions, you might as well tell me yours.
playerName... I'll try to remember that.
Back to the topic at hand.
I've been stuck in here for a while.
Somewhere called.... the Automaton Research Facility?
You wouldn't happen to know a place like that?
Then again, it doesn't matter. I'm still trapped.
I've been trying to get out for months. Or at least that's what the clocks in here say.
The building seems fully functional, but I have yet to come across any other forms of life.
The power generators are still running...
Seems like a waste of energy to me, but I can't really complain.
I assume it's been abandoned.
[STORY CUT FOR DEMO PURPOSES]
I'm going to have to find something to eat.
...
Alright, time to go.
[Something clangs in the distance.]
It sounds like... footsteps? Coming here.
That can't be right. I've been around this building about a hundred times. There's no-one in here.
Can you check the map schematics for me?
I'm going to find something to defend myself.
I managed to find this playerWeapon. It's a bit rusty, but it should do for now.
[The door scrapes against the ground.]
Wh-
[Something drops to the floor.]
This is going to sound far-fetched, but there's a swarm of things coming after me.
It's some sort of nanobot cloud...?
Can you check the map?
Which way should I go?
[A door shuts.]
Aah, I thought I was going to die for a minute there. Thanks for that.
I'm a little tired...
zzz... Huh...?
[STORY CUT FOR DEMO PURPOSES]
This must be the door.
It wouldn't have so much security otherwise.
Well, time to test out those codes we got.
You remember the one for the door?
Well, here goes nothing....
[An alarm begins to ring.]
"Foreign entity detected in the central server rooms."
"For purposes of data integrity, all data will be destroyed immediately."
Hey, hey wait, what's going on?
Wait-
