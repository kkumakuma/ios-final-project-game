The Outside?
Who are you?
I'm leaving.
Yes.
You don't know?
... What.
Huh.
playerName.
Hello Lilith.
You wanted my help?
Where's 'here'?
Automaton Research?
....
Good point.
What are you doing in there?
That sounds lonely.
That's odd.
Enjoy it while it lasts.
Are you really? I'm kidding.
[CONTINUE]
You don't need that.
I'll wait here.
Let's go.
What was that?
Footsteps?
Something's coming.
....
Be quick.
....
!!
On your right!
Get out of there!
What things?
Maybe you can hide somewhere?
Alright, I'm on it.
Go right!
....
You're all there, right?
Get moving. They'll be back.
Fine, just a quick rest.
