The Outside?
Who are you?
I'm leaving.
Yes.
You don't know?
... What.
Huh.
playerName.
Hello Lilith.
You wanted my help?
Where's 'here'?
Automaton Research?
....
Good point.
What are you doing in there?
That sounds lonely.
That's odd.
Enjoy it while it lasts.
Are you really? I'm kidding.
[CONTINUE]
You don't need that.
I'll wait here.
Let's go.
What was that?
Footsteps?
Something's coming.
Run.
Be quick.
You probably won't last.
!!
On your right!
Hurry!
Who's they!?
Maybe you can hide somewhere?
Alright, I'm on it.
Go right!
....
You're all there, right?
Get moving. They'll be back.
Sleep well.
[CONTINUE]
A breeze from the outside?
Let's go!
This is it.
Moment of truth.
(raise the alarm.)
